RouteTrieNode

Insert
_________________________________
I use a HashMap/dicitonary to store the children of a TrieNode,
so inserting a child character can be done in constant/O(1) time. 

Space is O(n) where n is the size of the path string being inserted into the RouteTrieNode.

Get Handler
_________________________________
Getting the handler from the RouteTrieNode is just retrieving the value of an instance variable,
so this is done in constant/O(1) time and space.

Set Handler
_________________________________
Setting the handler from the RouteTrieNode is just storing a value in an instance variable,
so this is done in constant/O(1) time.

Space is O(n) where n is the size of the handler string being stored.

RouteTrie


Insert
_________________________________
Since I need to iterate through the parts of the path to
do this, it takes linear/O(n) time where n is the number of parts (separated by "/").
However the runtime is constant/O(1) with respect to the size of the RouteTrie
itself, since it will take the same amount of time to insert a new path part
independent of the number of nodes in the RouteTrie.

The space is O(n*m) where n is the number of the path parts being inserted (in the
worst case, a new node will need to be created and inserted for every path), and m is the 
size of each path part string.

Find
_________________________________
The runtime here is the same as insertion. Linear time considering the number of
path parts, and constant time considering the size of/number of nodes in the RouteTrie.

Space is constant/O(1).

Router

Add Handler
_________________________________
This is just a wrapper for the RouteTrie insert method, so it takes linear time considering the number of
path parts (separated by "/"), and constant time considering the size of/number of nodes in the RouteTrie.

The space is O(n*m) where n is the number of the path parts being inserted, and m is the 
size of each path part string.

Lookup
_________________________________
This is just a wrapper for the RouteTrie find method, so it takes linear time considering the number of
path parts (separated by "/"), and constant time considering the size of/number of nodes in the RouteTrie.

Space is constant/O(1).
