I sort the 0's and 2's in place by swapping them to the beginning portion and end portions 
of the list respectively, which naturally places the 1's in the middle portion.

The runtime is linear/O(n) since I recursively traverse the input list once as I sort.
The space complexity is constant/O(1) since I am sorting in place.
